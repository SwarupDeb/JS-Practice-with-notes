// Types of memory-> Stack and Heap memory

//Stack used in Primitive->if you declare any variable you will get a copy

//Heap used in Non-Primitive ->if you define any object or something you will get refrence.So, if anything changed it will change in original value

// to access object we use .value(value = any name given in the object such as name , email etc)
